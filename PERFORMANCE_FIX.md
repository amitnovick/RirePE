# ðŸš€ Performance Fix Applied!

## Quick Start

Your client is slow when logging packets? **Here's the fix:**

### Step 1: Add this to your `RirePE.ini` file:

```ini
[Packet]
ENABLE_BLOCKING=0
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the project

```bash
# Open RirePE.sln in Visual Studio
# Build > Build Solution
```

### Step 3: Done!

Your client should now run at near-native speed even with heavy packet logging.

---

## What This Does

- **ENABLE_BLOCKING=0:** Packets are logged asynchronously (FAST âœ“)
- **ENABLE_BLOCKING=1:** Packets wait for block check (SLOW âœ—)

**Default:** 0 (fast mode)

## TL;DR

The client was slow because **every packet blocked waiting for a response from RirePE.exe**.

By making this optional (default: disabled), the client runs fast while still logging all packets.

If you need to block packets (use the "Block" checkbox), set `ENABLE_BLOCKING=1` in your config.

**Most users don't need blocking - they just want to view packets!**
